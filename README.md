# ReactChess

## Challenge!
### Write a simple chess program using ReactJS within a certain time

### [Demo (so far)](https://tariqksoliman.github.io/ReactChess/)

* #### Times (actual programming time and not time elapsed since beginning)
  * Gold   - Under 6 hrs 
  * Silver - Under 12 hrs
  * Bronze - Under 24 hrs

  * ##### So far
    * 4 hours:
      * Main code structure
      * Checkered 8x8 board
      * Ability to select pieces
      * Selecting pawns show possible movements
    * 4 hours:
      * All pieces move basically
      * Castling
      * Turns
      * Nice looking board
    * 3 hours:
      * Checks for checks
      * Turn and check messages
      * Visual update
    * 1 hour:
      * Displays captured pieces
    * 2 hours:
      * Pawn promotion
      * Can, as always, restart game by refreshing page

* #### Requirements
  * Must:
    * [X] An 8x8 board with lettering and numbering
    * [X] User(s) play(s) both sides (No AI)
    * [_] Displays full chess algebraic notation
    * [X] Selecting a piece shows all possible places to move
    * [X] Must have castling
    * [X] Must be able to promote pieces and select which ones to
    * [X] Must identify checks (though it misses only the message if a promoted pawn checks )
    * [X] Display captured pieces
    * [X] Be able to draw the game/new game
    * [X] Any obvious things I missed (such as: pieces are to be two and only two different colors)
  * Optional:
    * [_] En passant
    * [X] That it look nice
