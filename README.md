## Challenge!
### Write a simple chess program using ReactJS within a certain time

* #### Times (actual programming time and not time elapsed since beginning)
  * Gold   - Under 6 hrs 
  * Silver - Under 12 hrs
  * Bronze - Under 24 hrs

  * ##### So far
    * 4 hours:
      * Main code structure
      * Checkered 8x8 board
      * Ability to select pieces
      * Selecting pawns show possible movements
    * 4 hours:

    * Displays full chess algebraic notation
    * Selecting a piece shows all possible places to move
    * Must have castling
    * Must be able to promote pieces and select which ones to
    * Must identify checks, checkmates and stalemates
